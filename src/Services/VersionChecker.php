/**
 * Compares the currently-installed plugin version against the latest
 * stable release on Packagist and reports an update-available status.
 *
 * Designed for the Help & Documentation Overview card: gives operators
 * a low-effort way to see "am I on the latest?" without leaving SeAT.
 *
 * Resilience:
 *   - Result is cached for 6 hours so each visit doesn't hit Packagist
 *   - HTTP request has a 3-second timeout
 *   - Every failure path (network, malformed JSON, missing package data)
 *     swallows the error, logs a warning, and returns 'unknown' status
 *     so the Help page never errors out from a transient Packagist hiccup
 *
 * Standalone: no Manager Core dependency. Works exactly as well on a
 * vanilla SeAT install as on a fully-integrated stack.
 *
 * Pattern source: ported verbatim from SeAT Broadcast
 * (mattfalahe/seat-discord-pings) where it was introduced first. Same
 * pattern slots cleanly into other plugins by changing the constants
 * here — return shape is stable so Blade renderers can be copied.
